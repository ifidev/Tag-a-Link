## Tag a Link

### Goals
The main goal is to help users focus on discovering content that sparks their interest while skimming through listing pages, such as news sites, newsletters, or search results. Instead of opening countless tabs, users can tag and save links for later reading. The saved links are displayed as Previews in the side panel, allowing users to explore each page one by one, hassle-free.
